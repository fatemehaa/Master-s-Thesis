## The Effects of Sensory Augmentation on Spatial Knowledge Acquisition in a Virtual Reality City

Using the concept of sensorimotor contingencies, we investigate the transference of the
sense of North through a sensory augmentation device and analyse its possible impact
on spatial knowledge acquisition. To achieve this, a virtual reality city was designed consisting
of streets and earmarked task-relevant buildings. Two groups of participants explored
these streets to find the location of the buildings and were tested on this knowledge
through a set of pointing and building placement tasks. The feelSpace belt augmented a
sense of North which the experimental group trained with prior to exploration, and used
throughout the experimental procedure. In line with previous research, the feelSpace belt
induced perceptual changes, as participants reported an improvement in their spatial navigation
strategies following a six-week training period. More importantly, our findings show
that exploring the city with the belt resulted in a higher pointing and building placement
accuracy. The task performance of the experimental group indicates that exploration using
the sensory augmentation device resulted in the acquisition of a higher level of survey
knowledge as well as advanced spatial knowledge.
